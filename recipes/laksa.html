        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Laksa is a spicy noodle dish popular in Southeast Asia. </p>
        <p>Laksa consists of various types of noodles, most commonly thick rice noodles,</p>
        <p>with toppings such as chicken, prawn or fish.</p>
        <p>Most variations of laksa are prepared with a rich and spicy coconut soup</p>
        <p>or a broth seasoned with sour asam.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>peanut or coconut oil</li>
            <li>laksa paste</li>
            <li>chicken stock or broth</li>
            <li>lime leaves</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>brown sugar or palm sugar</li>
            <li>chicken thighs</li>
            <li>raw large prawns</li>
            <li>coconut milk</li>
            <li>lime juice</li>
            <li>fish sauce</li>
            <li>ice noodles</li>
            <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong>bean sprouts, lime wedges, fried shallots</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook rice noodles according to directions. Set aside. </li>
            <li>In a large heavy-bottom soup pot or dutch oven, heat  3 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add all the homemade Laksa Paste  (or the 7-ounce Jar), and saute, stirring constantly until it becomes very fragrant and deep in color about 2-3 minutes. (Turn stove fan on- it will smell strong- don’t worry.). Add the chicken broth, scraping up all the brown bits.  Add the lime leaves, salt and sugar and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and simmer 4-5 minutes. Add shrimp, cook for 2-3 minutes, add coconut milk. Simmer until heated through. Do not boil this too long or you will lose the lovely sweetness from the coconut milk– just gently warm.</li>
            <li>Add lime juice, starting with a 1 lime, and add more to taste. Add fish sauce to taste, adding a teaspoon at a time. The broth should taste rich and deep, and slightly salty (the noodles will mellow the salt out) and just a little limey. If it tastes, too “fishy” add more lime juice. Guests can squeeze more lime to taste. If you want more heat, add chili flakes or chili paste.</li>
            <li>Divide the cooked rice noodles among bowls. Ladle flavorful soup over top of noodles. Top bowls with a handful of fresh bean sprouts, fresh cilantro and/or mint.  Serve with chili sauce and lime wedges.</li>
            <li>For rice noodles, calculate two ounces ( dry rice noodles ) per person.</li>
